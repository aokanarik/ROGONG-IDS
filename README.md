# ROGONG-IDS
# A ROBUST GRADIENT BOOSTING MODEL BASED ON SMOTE AND NEAR MISS METHODS FOR INTRUSION DETECTION IN IMBALANCED DATA SETS


Novel technologies cause many security vulnerabilities and zero-day attack risks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are developed to protect computer networks from threats and attacks. Many challenging problems need to be solved in existing methods. The class imbalance problem is one of the most difficult problems of IDS, and it reduces the detection rate performance of the classifiers. The highest IDS detection rate in the literature is 96.54%. This thesis proposes a new model called ROGONG-IDS (Robust Gradient Boosting) based on Gradient Boosting. ROGONG- IDS model uses Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Near Miss methods to handle class imbalance. Three different gradient boosting-based classification algorithms (GBM, LightGBM, XGBoost) were compared. The performance of the proposed model on multiclass classification has been verified in the UNSW-NB15 dataset. It reached the highest attack detection rate and ùêπ1 score in the literature with a 97.30% detection rate and 97.65% ùêπ1 score. ROGONG-IDS provides a robust, efficient solution for IDS built on datasets with the imbalanced class distribution. It outperforms state-of-the-art and traditional intrusion detection methods
